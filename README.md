# CalSnap
This application will allow users to easily track calorie intake on a daily basis.  This can be tedious with other 
apps and the intention of CalSnap is to make it easy.  If it isn't easy, you won't use it.  So, it allows the user
to simply take a picture of the item with their phone camera and it determines calories.  Another click to consume it 
and it is added to your daily caloric total.  The app will also allow the user to snap a barcode or enter the name
of the item with keyboard entry.
